         * The Open-Closed Principle states that software entities (such as classes, modules, functions)
         * should be open for extension but closed for modification.
         * This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a system without altering existing code.
         * This is typically achieved through the use of abstraction, interfaces, and inheritance.
         * By adhering to this principle, you can avoid introducing bugs in existing code
         * while still being able to add new features.
